# Stress Detection Using Physiological Signals (WESAD Dataset) 📊🧠

This project explores the use of deep learning models for binary classification of stress using the WESAD dataset. It focuses on ECG, EDA, and RESP signals to determine whether a subject is stressed or not.

## 📁 Dataset

We use the **WESAD** dataset (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) by Schmidt et al., which contains physiological signals from 15 participants. Since this dataset is not available on Kaggle by default, we uploaded it to a public Kaggle dataset:

## 🌐 Infrastructure

To upload the dataset to Kaggle (due to internet limitations in Egypt), we created a **Google Cloud VPS** instance. This made it possible to download the original dataset from UCI and re-upload it to Kaggle.

## 🧪 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Extracted relevant signals (ECG, EDA, RESP) for all subjects.
   - Normalized signals using MinMaxScaler.
   - Segmented time-series data into overlapping windows.
   - Created binary labels (0 = Not Stressed, 1 = Stressed).

2. **Visualization**
   - Plotted ECG samples for stressed vs. non-stressed participants.
   - Graphed class distribution to ensure balanced training.

3. **Modeling**
   - Used a fully connected deep learning model via **Keras**.
   - Input shape: 900 (segmented data across the 3 signals).
   - Binary classification with sigmoid activation.

4. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score calculated.
   - Confusion matrix and classification report provided.

## 📊 Results

The model achieved high accuracy and solid performance metrics across multiple subjects. The results confirm that even with a simple architecture, stress can be predicted using physiological signals.
