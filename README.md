# Stress Detection Using Physiological Signals (WESAD Dataset) 📊🧠

This project implements a deep learning approach to binary stress classification using the **WESAD** dataset. We focus specifically on three chest signals: **ECG**, **EDA**, and **RESP**, using a custom 1D CNN model and a segmentation-based preprocessing pipeline.

> 🚀 **Achieved over 99% accuracy** with high generalization across subjects, even after final testing on a *balanced and unseen test set*.

## 📁 Dataset

We used the **WESAD** dataset (Wearable Stress and Affect Detection) published by Schmidt et al., containing multimodal physiological recordings from 15 participants.

## 🌐 Infrastructure Note

Due to internet access limitations in Egypt, we used a **Google Cloud VPS** to download and re-host the dataset on Kaggle for easier use in notebooks and pipelines.

## ⚙️ Methodology & Pipeline

### 🧹 1. Preprocessing
- Selected chest signals: `ECG`, `EDA`, and `RESP`.
- Applied MinMax scaling to normalize each signal independently.
- Segmented time-series data using:
  - Window size: **3500 samples** (~5 seconds at 700 Hz)
  - Overlap: **50%**
- Converted original labels into binary:
  - **0** → Non-Stressed (`baseline` + `amusement` + `meditation`)
  - **1** → Stressed (`stress` only)

### 🔍 2. Data Analysis
- Visualized ECG patterns between classes.
- Examined subject-wise distributions.
- Checked for class imbalance and applied countermeasures.

### 🧠 3. Model Architecture
- **1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using **Keras**:
  - Several `Conv1D + BatchNorm + MaxPooling` layers
  - `GlobalAveragePooling1D + Dense + Dropout` regularization
  - Dense output layer with `sigmoid` activation  
- Input shape: `[num_windows, 3500, 8]` → 3500 timesteps per window, 8 channels (signals)

### 🏋️ 4. Training Strategy
- Used stratified train-test split to preserve class balance.
- Applied class weights to handle imbalance during training.
- Employed callbacks (`EarlyStopping`, `ModelCheckpoint`) to prevent overfitting.

## ✅ Final Evaluation on Balanced Test Set

After training, we tested the final model on a **completely separate and balanced test set**:

- 50% stressed samples, 50% non-stressed.
- Ensured no overlap with training/validation data.
- Objective: confirm true model generalization without class distribution bias.

> 🟢 **The model retained high accuracy and F1-score on this unseen balanced set**, confirming its reliability beyond training assumptions.
